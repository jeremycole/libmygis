0.7.5     2007-11-25

  * Added missing -P command-line option to mysqlgisimport.
  * Fixed problems with recursive build.

0.7.3     2007-02-23

  * Fixed a bug with complex projections which use a different projection
    not based on meters.  The x_0 and y_0 parameters are now converted to
    meters before being passed to PROJ.4.  Thanks to Adam Dingle for finding
    this bug.

0.7.2     2007-01-14

0.7.0     2007-01-12
