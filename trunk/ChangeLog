libmygis ChangeLog
==================

VERSION 0.8
***********

0.8.0     2008-07-09

  * Overhauled the entire build system, now uses libtool to build the
    libraries and does recursive build correctly.
  * Overhauled all .h files for public use from /usr/include and
    created many *_priv.h files for internal use.
  * Created .spec file for building of RPMs.
  * Removed tools/mysqlgisimport, created new mysqlgistools project
    to contain this and other future tools.
  * Removed MySQL linkages from libmygis project.
  * Lots of cleanup of build system.
  * Updated copyright years.

VERSION 0.7
***********

0.7.5     2007-11-25

  * Added missing -P command-line option to mysqlgisimport.
  * Fixed problems with recursive build.
  * Fixed tests/test_shapefile so that it doesn't try to seek past the
    end of the file when dumping records.
  * Finished projection support and cleaned up projection code.

0.7.3     2007-02-23

  * Fixed a bug with complex projections which use a different projection
    not based on meters.  The x_0 and y_0 parameters are now converted to
    meters before being passed to PROJ.4.  Thanks to Adam Dingle for finding
    this bug.

0.7.2     2007-01-14

  * Updated copyright to 2007.
  * Changed the PRJ parser to use YYPARSE_PARAM so that it can be thread-
    safe and reentrant.

  * Oops, did not free memory for MULTIPOLYGON.

0.7.0     2007-01-12

  * Added support for MULTIPOLYGON.
  * Changed Shapefile parsing to parse Shapefile POLYGON to internal

    external rings.
