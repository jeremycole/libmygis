The mysqlgisimport program has been moved to mysqlgistools package
which uses libmygis.  You can find the new package here:

I hope this makes it easier to use libmygis in many other software
packages in the future.  In addition this will make it much easier
to bear the linkages to the MySQL client libraries required for
some planned features in mysqlgisimport and other tools.
